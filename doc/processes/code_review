# Code Review Process

## Step 1: Reivew Logical Flow

Make sure that the logic of the code is sound and that all flow makes sense and uses the appropriate data for preforming certain operations

## Step 2: Math/Operations

Make sure that the mathematical operations that take place coinside with the desired output and that most general test and edge cases create desired output

## Step 3: Syntax / Form

Make sure that the syntax and form of the code follows not only java conventions but also is generally readable, editable and documented. Also, abstraction and encapsulation should be evaluated, and we should ask whether or not certain methods or class need to exist or should be abstracted or removed.

## Step 4: Integration

Make sure that the body of code make sense in our current design/philosophy and that it properly integrates in our system without violating the fundamental rules that we have adopted.

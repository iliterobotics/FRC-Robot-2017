# Week 3 General Notes
---

## Plans for 3rd week

At the beginning of our third week of work we determined that there were 3 main tasks that needed to be completed this week. They are: Determining use of vision/vision solution, determining what sensors we would need for this year and what research would have to be done to make use of them, and determining what telemetry data would be collected. As for specific tasks of the week, we split our work among the major tasks of writing the *Android OpenCV* app which would be used to process the image captured by the phone's camera, writing the autonomous turning code using the *NavX* board.
